    <h1 class="title">Example Scenarios </h1>
	  <p>We have identified some hypothetical and possibly medically incorrect scenarios that you could test in our demo. </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Scenario 1: </strong>Ms. Alice, an employee of PQR Corp., goes to a physician Dr. Bob with an incessant headache, weakness, bouts of forgetfulness and drowsiness. Dr. Bob diagnoses this as a potential case of depresssion. He then refers her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Charlie, for diagnosis. Dr. Charlie identifies that she is suffering from dissociative identity disorder. Can he inform Alice's relatives and her bosses at PQR Corp. about her condition? Can he send this diagnosis and prescription back to Dr. Bob? Can he share this information with her company's insurance agency. </li>
	    <li><strong>Scenario 2: </strong>Ms. Alice, a victim of depression, suddenly collapses at work. She is taken to the emergency department at the PA hospital where she is treated by Dr. Bob. What info can Dr. Bob access through the PHI Access system? Dr. Bob believes that she might need a liver transplant, for which he approaches Dr. Sue, the surgeon. She confirms this prognosis. Dr. Charlie, the psychiatrist, learns about Ms. Alice's visit to the hospital when she does not show up for a session. Should he now reveal to the transplant committee and Dr. Sue that Ms. Alice might have suicidal tendencies? </li>
